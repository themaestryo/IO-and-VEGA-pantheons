conquest - freedom
stone - breath

The natural cycle is Time -> Illumination -> Satisfaction -> Silence -> Stone -> Mystery -> Space -> Hunger -> Breath -> Freedom -> Song -> Conquest (-> Time -> and so on). That's the way it first happened, but it's important to remember that Io and Vega each started from Space and Time respectively, each completing the cycle equally and oppositely in perfect sync. So, the order is always the same, but the starting point is always up for debate. 

This is the basis of the world's calendar, so there are twelve months, each of which corresponds to an aspect. January is Time, because Time is traditionally the "start", so Time is the first month of the new year. 

I'm explaining all of this so weirdly but that's what happens when you try to invent gods. See, now that I've written that out directly, I feel like I'm committing some kind of blasphemy, but that's just my ex-Christian conditioning; my Lord Apollon wouldn't be mad about me making stuff up for fun and for the purposes of creativity, and he also doesn't have any hang-ups about "thou shalt not even think about other gods or I'll get really pissed", so. Whatever.
