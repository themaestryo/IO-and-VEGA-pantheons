[[Eelin]], God of Cleverness & Ambition (Time + Illumination)
- eelin's iconic, love him or hate him, his clever wiles and cheeky tricks are unfortunately kind of sexy. both he and aurelie are kinda trickster gods, but he's definitely more of a trickster than she is.
- also like aurelie, he rose to godhood from mortality. unlike aurelie, he scammed his way to the top. where aurelie charmed io so much she was granted godhood, eelin tricked vega into it. luckily, vega is amused by tricks (unlike io WHO HATES TO BE CONFUSED), so he let him keep it.
- he and aurelie have known each other since they were both mortal. they're old friends but not super tight
- eelin is not an evil god!!!! he is a god of ambition. which is similar in many ways, but not the same
- lots of parallels to aurelie here: where she's generally regarded as a strictly youthful god, eelin can appear to be many ages, and generally tends to go for older images (30-50 range). 
- eelin is a SCAMMER!!!! you can pray to him for help but he will probably also go help the other guys. or fuck you both over for kicks

[[Pae-Din Ma]], God of Death & Grief (Satisfaction + Silence)
- loooooove pae-din ma. just the sound of it. pae-din ma.
- pae-din ma is a god and also a place. the place is the god. and vice versa. pae-din ma is like purgatory, it's the place everyone goes when they die before they're sorted to go somewhere else. it's the waiting room
- it's generally believed that, if you're judged to deserve heaven, you can choose to wait in pae-din ma for your loved ones. it's also believed, through many folk tales, that it's possible to make a deal with the entities in pae-din ma to let you wait around even if you're supposed to go to hell (there's at least two: vantaris's hell and anadin's hell), but this would involve hiding from pae-din ma itself
- people say "see you in pae-din ma" when they're dying
- as a god of satisfaction and silence, pae-din ma deals with loss, grief, and comfort. when you die, going to pae-din ma is not suffering; it's quite peaceful. even terrible people are granted the grace of staying in pae-din ma for a bit before damnation, and this is pae-din ma's gift. there have been very few times in all of history that someone has been denied the privilege of going to pae-din ma upon death
- because it's usually busy being a place, pae-din ma is not a very vocal or direct god

[[Maquina]], God of Machines & Artifice (Stone + Mystery)
- MACHIIIIINE GOOOOOOD
- what is there to say. she is a machine. she is THE machine. the great machine. 
- builders, craftsmen, engineers, etc. pray to maquina. she is both the machine and the builder
- people offer up their creations to her, and every accepted creation becomes a part of maquina's body. she has a lot of different religious sects that fight about what should and should not be considered part of maquina's body, and how parts of her body should be treated.
- she's a god of innovation and invention. but she also really values independence and drive, so she prefers to let her followers do things on their own and then reward them later, rather than just give them divine blueprints
- she ascends her favorite devotees to come be her mechanics
- she kind of has beef with anadin, because they handle the aspect of stone so differently-- she's all about the future, while anadin cares more about preserving the present

[[Vantaris]], God of Punishment & Necessity (Space + Hunger)
- vantaris is the god of What Must Be Done, even if it isn't pleasant. the god of dark necessity
- vantaris's aspect of space has to do with the order and position of things, the way things are "meant to be". their aspect of hunger is the necessity part-- the drive to do what it takes to make things "right"
- vantaris is a god of judgement. when normal people die, pae-din ma decides where they go next. when heroes and villains die, their fates are left to vantaris. 

[[Etulli]], God of Peace & Bounty (Breath + Freedom)
- hands-down nicest god in the pantheon, but when it comes down to it, she's actually lawful neutral.
- etulli covers the harvest, fertility, etc. but she's not as much of a family god as oros leiha is, because etulli has the freedom aspect. she cares more about individual joy.
- as a breath god, etulli is a god of vitality. she's a healer and good health is attributed to her
- she CANNOT STAND eelin. but she loves aurelie. in kind of a mother-daughter way i think.

[[The Iron Lady]], God of Vengeance & War (Song + Conquest)
- counterpart/equal/mirror/whatever of the maiden-in-chains. where the maiden represents the woman suffering, the iron lady is the manifestation of the woman unleashed. 
- she's a god of vengeance and blind fury, so she's usually down to help anyone angry enough. but if she thinks you're having a problem meant for the maiden-in-chains, she will just ignore you
- has some beef with vantaris because they have different definitions of What Must Be Done
