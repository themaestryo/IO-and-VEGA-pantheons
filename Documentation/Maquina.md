There are two types of documentation on the gods: in-character and out-of-character. The former is documentation that is in-universe, written from the perspective of someone in the world-- it's subjective and limited by the perspective of the fictional writer. The latter is official documentation from, y'know, real life-- Ryo's word of gospel. 

This is Maquina's OOC official documentation.

PANTHEON: Lunar
ASPECTS: [[Stone]] + [[Mystery]]
TITLES:
- God of Machines & Artifice 
- The Cold Goddess
- The Evolving Engine
- The Perpetual Motion Machine (this is a compliment apparently)
- Queen of Steel (these people hate the iron lady)

Notable Groups:
- The Mechanics' Guild
	- Major group of Maquina followers-- one might consider the Guild as the one thing most Maquina devotees can agree upon. Even the most isolated sects have members in the Guild. The Guild manages patents and other bureaucratic matters among inventors, as well as helps secure work for members. The actual location of the Guild and its surrounding area are considered neutral territory-- when you're there, you're only there to work or talk shop. No violence in the Guild.
- The Order of The Perpetual Motion Machine
	- Maquina's most devoted and fervent religious sect; some call it a cult. They strictly abide by the Manual, a sacred text supposedly drafted by the first mechanics to join Maquina in her divine abode-- the story goes that they bestowed the Manual upon the next generation shortly after ascension. The Manual calls for careful adherence to a number of holy principles and instructions, including the collection, maintenance, and worship of machinery considered to be part of Maquina. The Order is also known for destroying so-called sacrilegious machinery, and sometimes the inventors behind it. Additionally, majority of the Order believes that Maquina ought to have dominion over the aspects of Conquest and Song, and they resent the Iron Lady for her power over these aspects. Critics of this group accuse them of going against Maquina's aspect of Mystery.
- The Keepers of The Evolving Engine
	- Directly in opposition to the Order are the Keepers, who believe that all mechanical work, great or small, is in some way part of Maquina and her "great blueprint". They spend a lot of their time and resources on recovering lost machinery in ruins, believing these to be parts taken and hidden away from Maquina in order to halt her evolution. The Keepers believe that Maquina has a great plan, but do not believe themselves worthy of understanding it, keeping in line with the aspect of Mystery.
