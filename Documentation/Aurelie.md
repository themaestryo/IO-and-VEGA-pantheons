There are two types of documentation on the gods: in-character and out-of-character. The former is documentation that is in-universe, written from the perspective of someone in the world-- it's subjective and limited by the perspective of the fictional writer. The latter is official documentation from, y'know, real life-- Ryo's word of gospel. 

This is Aurelie's OOC official documentation.
