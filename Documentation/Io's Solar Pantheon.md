[[Ysarys Aurelion]], God of Truth and Temperance (Illumination + Satisfaction) 


[[Anadin]], God of Strength & Protection (Silence + Stone)
- anadin is a god of strength and protection, but he's also actually a god of stoicism. because of his stone aspect, obviously. and the silence, too, actually. 
- anadin supposedly lends his strength to those with the courage to face what threatens them with a stone conviction and unflinching resolve. anadin would be wild about honorable ronins killing themselves properly. he'd probably honor those guys or something. but anadin has no domain over death, so.
- anadin is a very neutral god, all things considered. he doesn't care if you're good or bad; he cares about how you hold yourself. are you deserving of his protection?
- needless to say anadin worshippers are very intense and not a lot of fun
- i think he and machina (from the lunar pantheon) are in love. but that's just my personal guess.

[[Kor]], God of Travel & Discovery (Mystery + Space)
- gotta love kor. very mysterious, very secretive. any kind of underground society, especially of thieves and other sneaky types, are probably praying to kor. 
- kor favors wanderers and adventurers, and prefers for them to be literally going around exploring, but she's also been known to take a shine to some explorers of thought. but not artists. unfortunately kor hates artists. i don't know why.
- actually i do. artists are trying to engineer mystery; that's not their job. kor wants you to explore existing mysteries. and to keep them secret. honestly everything about artists is way too in-your-face for kor. she might like a reclusive, mysterious artist, but why are you putting all your mysteries out into the world in the first place? 

[[Oros Leiha]], God of Loyalty & Longing (Hunger + Breath)
- wolf god
- she's so cool
- leiha is a very very big wolf. she definitely started as a wolf before becoming a god. she ferociously defends her loved ones, and as a wolf, she can have a pretty extended pack. no matter how many people she adds to her list of beloveds, though, the wolf's hunger can never be satisfied, and her ability to love is never diminished. 
- also she wants to eat everyone she loves. sorry. it's The Hunger. but for leiha love and consumption are the same thing, so. 
- she may also eat people she doesn't love, but that is different!!!! she is simply trying to kill them, probably for threatening someone she loves
- incredibly hard to reason with. one of the most emotional of the solar pantheon, which is already the more emotional of the two pantheons. 
- she had a husband but he's dead

[[Aurelie]], God of Joy & Mischief (Freedom + Song)
- what can i say she's a delight. io found her so charming that she was granted godhood. she mostly uses it to fuck around and have fun.
- aurelie is one of the few gods that like. everyone knows exactly how that happened. she was a famous adventurer, known for her cheerful spirit and general likeability, and then she Met God, and god liked her, so now she's also a god. pretty much everyone is cool with this because they all like aurelie.
- okay that is not true. that is something aurelie wants everyone to believe, because she can't stand haters. they kill her vibe. aurelie's aspect of song is about celebration, but it's also a siren song. 
- aurelie is also a god of temptation i think. something like that. not sure.
- she has some connection to etulli from the lunar pantheon

[[Maiden-In-Chains]], God of Suffering & Survival (Conquest + Time)
- first of all i'm her biggest fan. 
- she has many names that i'll write down when i make individual pages for all my little guys
- largely regarded as the god of "dark womanhood". like, womanhood, but all the dark parts of it. the bits that sexism makes so bad. like, the overworked and underappreciated housewife, the abandoned single mother, the rape victim, the woman with post-partum depression, etc. 
- that said, she's not only a god for women. she's a god for victims and prisoners.
- the maiden-in-chains is NOT a god of freedom, so you don't pray to her for release. you pray to her to hang on. to hold onto yourself despite it all. to grit your teeth and bear it. she's a god of inner strength
- she's a god of rage. feminine rage is key. but she's weirdly also a god of patience. biding your time. waiting for an opportunity.
- has a strong connection to the Iron Lady, but everybody has different opinions on what exactly it is. they might be siblings, parent and child, mirrors of one another. they might be the same person: one before she escaped, and one after. maybe she was first chained, then released. maybe she was raging free, then was chained. maybe they're two versions of what could have happened-- in one version, the maiden remains chained, and in the other, the lady breaks free. some say that the iron lady is the one who chained the maiden. some say they're two gods who switch places. some say that the maiden is the lady's heart, or vice versa. nobody knows!
- they know
