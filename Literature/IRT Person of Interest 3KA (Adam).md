No information in this file should be considered official Agency data for the purposes of implementing procedures; NDA requirements continue to apply.

NOTE: Guys, I know everyone is curious about POIs, but this is one it's really not worth being curious about. In any case, you *have* to stop writing notes and having conversations in official files. Watercooler talk should stay at the watercooler. 

ALIASES: (Son of) The Wolf, True Alpha, Adam
THREAT LEVEL: 4
PROCEDURES: 
- Avoid direct contact of any kind-- eye contact across the room is enough for him to get his claws in. If contact must be made, it should be by a male-identifying agent assigned male at birth, as this is the kind of person least likely to hold Adam's attention. Contact must be approved before initiating.
- Agents should not appear around Adam unless following strict clothing guidelines. Said clothes must not be provocative, but should also not cover up too much; uniforms are permitted. (Seriously? What's the deal with that? -Trill) (He consented to an interview once. Apparently, leaving too much to the imagination makes him, well, imagine what he wants to see. -Arden)
	- ADDENDUM: Uniforms are no longer permissible attire for appearing in Adam's vicinity. Agents should appear in plainclothes only. (Guess who got a second interview? Apparently, the Agency's interactions with this guy have given him some kinda fetish for agents. Go figure. -Arden)
- No attempts should be made to capture, subdue, or disable Adam without proper authorization, even in the case of life-threatening emergency. (So, what? Is he dangerous? So dangerous it'd do more harm to stop him? -Trill) (Stop snooping around in the files if you're not going to read them all the way through. -Arden)
- In the case of a Wolf Moon, agents are to disengage from any missions involving proximity to Adam. 


DESCRIPTION
Adam is one of many names used to refer to 3KA. His true identity remains uncertain, as attempts to obtain legal information about the subject have thusfar proven fruitless. 

It is understood that he has some connection to the minor god Roakin, though the nature of this connection is unclear. Speculations include that he is Roakin's vessel, that he is Roakin's son, that he is in fact Roakin or some part of him made mortal(?). Some also theorize a connection to Eelin.

Adam, like all "Sons of The Wolf", has the gift of powerful suggestion in a sexual context. This power is believed to come from Roakin, though the how and why are unclear. Adam's power of suggestion seems significantly stronger than others like him; records show that Adam has proven capable of controlling (EXPUNGED IN ACCORDANCE W/ POI AGREEMENT 6521) people simultaneously, and exerting a degree of control over individuals that is virtually impossible to break out of once targeted. 

Adam appears to have a fixation on breeding, which is shared by others of his kind. Where most will make prey of the closest breathing thing during a Wolf Moon, Adam seems to have a preference for things considered "debauched" or, in his own words, "nasty." 
(Please tell me this is a joke. -Trill)
(No, he said that, and he specifically asked to include it. -Arden)

While Adam is a dangerous individual that agents should be made aware of, his value to the Agency lies in his connections. Naturally, Adam has a great deal of influence over many social spheres-- for better or worse-- and is thus a powerful person to know. 
(Great, so, he's important because he's fucked everyone? -Trill)

Of the utmost importance is the fact that Adam is known to have some connection to POI 3MQ "Steel". Requests for contact with Steel through Adam have proven unsuccessful. Further details are available with administrative approval.
(Oh, shit. Okay. I see now. He knows Steel. -Trill)
(Are you kidding? He *fucked* Steel. -Arden)
