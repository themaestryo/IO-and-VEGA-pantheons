Chapter 3: Aurelie, Who Is Always Invited (Excerpt)

...ever sweet, ever polite, Aurelie apologized for appearing uninvited in the presence of the Sun. But Io had seen Aurelie's joyful spirit and generous nature in action, and was charmed-- and she informed Aurelie, in no uncertain terms, that she would always be invited.

It is a long-time topic of debate whether Io intended to bestow the gift of an epithet upon Aurelie in this moment, but the fact stands that the gift was given. The simple phrase, "You are always invited, Aurelie," made itself true; Aurelie would indeed always be invited. 

No conversation could ever be private enough, no hideout secluded enough-- Aurelie would always be invited, even if she wasn't wanted. Her epithet is She Who Is Always Invited, though some call her Aurelie, Who Cannot Be Denied. 

Some scholars and devotees claim that the gods of Mystery were displeased with Aurelie's new epithet at first, but elected not to act on these concerns. This, supposedly, is due to Io's fickle and flighty nature-- just as easily as she could give such a great gift, she could bring on a curse or bless someone else in the next moment.
