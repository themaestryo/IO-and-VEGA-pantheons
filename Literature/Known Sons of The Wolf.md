"Adam" - firstborn, alpha, mastermind
"Simon" - logistics? apparently harmless bookshop owner, but reports about his level of involvement are conflicting
"Cal" - seems like just some sort of thug. multiple arrests, known felon-- mostly violence and various types of assault. 
"Jang" - known figure in the entertainment industry, a manager or producer or ceo or something. he's powerful
"Sleepy" - former Chaser! member. not sure why he split from the group, or if he was kicked out. has stronger-than-usual power of suggestion, but it's pretty obviously a pimu-fueled brute force power, not natural like adam's. reports claim that if his focus is broken, the effect breaks immediately-- again, not like adam's, which requires only his presence (and sometimes not even that)
