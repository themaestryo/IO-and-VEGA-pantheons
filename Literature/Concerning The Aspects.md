(excerpt)

The Aspects, of course, are the essences of all which Io and Vega put forth into being. While one might initially assume that having dominion over more aspects makes you powerful, scholars have identified a pattern in the pantheons that suggests *fewer* aspects indicates greater power.

For example, while Io and Vega inhabit and represent each and every aspect, their true dominions are over Space and Time (respectively). This means that the Holy Twins each have only one main dominion, over which they have extreme control. 

Below them in hierarchy are the gods of the Solar and Lunar Pantheons, each of whom has dominion over no more and no less than two aspects. This appears to be the ideal, or at least the desired, design in line with the Twins' wishes. The two aspects work in balance with one another, and ensure that each god is balanced by others.

Further down are the minor gods, who tend to hold power over three or four domains, with generally weaker levels of control.

Of course, this is a descriptive point rather than a prescriptive one, as a god who is already powerful will not necessarily weaken after obtaining another aspect. One supposes that truly harnessing the power of an aspect requires great focus and control; perhaps taking on more makes the task more difficult, but not necessarily impossible. 

It is hypothetically possible that some gods, of some unknown pantheon, in times unthinkable, might have attempted to take on more aspects in spite of already having the privilege of two aspects and a seat in the pantheon. Were that the case, which is highly unlikely, one possibility is that these gods might have fallen to ruin, or perhaps even been driven to it. This, of course, is mere speculation; an important disclaimer that need not necessarily be made, but is made on the off chance that any of the pointless musings prior come anywhere close to breaching the law of The Starving Duke.
